# Configuration options
#
# You can override anything you see in the "conf:" tree in box/box.yml here!
# Additionally, there are a few properties you can set here that do not have
# defaults in box.yml that you may find useful.
#
# APK REPOS
# Uncomment to use your favorite APK mirror
# Only add the URL pointing the mirror root, everything else is added automatically!
# For example, if you set the following:
#alpine_mirror: http://cache.local/alpine
# it will resolve to:
# http://cache.local/alpine/v3.3/{main,community}
# -AND-
# http://cache.local/alpine/edge/{main,community,testing}
#
# PORT
# We assume we're running on the same host as dnsmasq-in-a-box and acting as a resolver for it,
# but if unbound is your only resolver you should look in run.yml and adjust the ports: line
# accordingly.
