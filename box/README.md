# Box Files
This directory contains files needed to build the box. Typically this includes:
 * A `Dockerfile` for building a container
 * Configuration file *templates*
 * An `outside.sh` *bash* script for doing things on the host
 * An `inside.sh` *ash* script for doing things inside the box
 * Other miscellaneous support files that the box may find useful
